# SHABDAKOSH

This web app allows one to store words with their meaning. I wanted to save new words that I find as 
I read books somewhere at the same time wanted to use MongoDb, Play and scala. So wrote this application. 

## How to Run
1. Start Mongo DB. (For personal sure the database is part of this project now)
   ```  
   mongod --dbpath /shabdkosh/db
   ```
2. Start the webserver.
   ``` 
   sbt run
   ```
